# ifeatpro (Physicochemical Feature Encoder for Protein Sequences)
A python package that generates 21 numerically encoded feature representation for protein sequences based on their 
physicochemical properties. 

**Note: ifeatpro is based on iFeature, a python based toolkit available at 
[link](https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeature/). Here, we have packaged 21 alignment free feature encoding functions 
available in iFeature into a pip installable module for easy usage and improved accessibility of a protein feature 
encoding tool.**
